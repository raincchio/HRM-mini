# üåü Welcome to the **HRM-Mini** Repository

This repository is designed to help **any user** explore and test the **reasoning ability of HRM** with *minimal computational resources*.

For example, you can train **HRM-Mini** on an **M1 Pro MacBook** in **under 10 hours** ‚Äî making it perfect for lightweight experimentation and learning.


## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to quickly set up and launch **HRM-Mini** on an **Ubuntu 24** server.


### üß© Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

Using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html):

```bash
conda create -n mini python=3.12
conda activate mini
```


### üì¶ Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install pytorch framework, you can choose the specific command based on 

https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

Make sure you have `requirements.txt` in your project directory, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### üß† Step 3: Try Out HRM-Mini

```bash
cd HRM-Mini
jupyter notebook --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=8888
```

After launching, click the link that looks like:

```
http://localhost:8888/?token=xxxxxx
```

Log in through your browser and open **`hrm_mini.ipynb`** to start your first reasoning experiment.

```
1_download_data.ipynb shows the data preparation process.
2_hrm_mini_train.ipynb shows the training process, using only 1k samples.
3_hrm_mini_eval.ipynb shows the evaluation process, where the model is evaluated on a hard puzzle.
4_hrm_mini_test.ipynb shows the testing process, where you can use your own defined Sudoku puzzle to test HRM Mini's performance.
```

## üí° Tips

* For best performance, close other high-CPU tasks while training.
* You can edit `hrm_mini.ipynb` to customize parameters or try your own datasets.
* The notebook works smoothly on most modern laptops and desktops.
